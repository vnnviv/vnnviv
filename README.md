# Hello, i'm Vivian!

Machine learning researcher focused on quantitative finance and stock price prediction.

## About me

I started coding in high school and got really into the intersection of finance and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in how we can use GANs and other generative models to improve financial forecasting.

Right now I'm working on a research project that uses both real and synthetic stock data to build better predictive models. The core question I'm exploring: can synthetic data actually help ML models generalize better to real market conditions?

## what i work with

**Languages & Tools**
- Python
- PyTorch
- SQL
- Google Colab (GPU work)
- Git

**ML Stuff**
- LSTM networks
- GANs (CycleGAN, Wasserstein GAN)
- Time series forecasting
- Synthetic data generation

**Finance**
- Stock market data analysis
- Quantitative modeling
- Risk management concepts
- Trading algorithms

## current project

**Stock Price Prediction Using Real and Simulated Data**

Working on comparing different models (LSTM, Quantum-LSTM, CycleGAN) trained on hybrid datasets to see what actually works best for predicting stock prices. Using AAPL data from 2020-2023.
